Look down, look down.
Don't look 'em in the eye.
Look down, look down.
You're here until you die.

Now prisoner 24601.
Your time is up And your parole's begun.
You know what that means.

Yes, it means I'm free.

No!
Follow to the letter your itinerary.
This badge of shame you wear until you die.
It warns that you're a dangerous man.

I stole a loaf of bread.
My sisters child was close to death.
And we were starving...

And you will starve again unless you learn the meaning ofthe law!

I've learnt the meaning of those nineteen years.
A slave of the law.

Five years for what you did.
The rest because you tried to run.
Yes, 24601.

Jean Valjean

My name is Jean Valjean!

And I'm Javert!
Do not forget my name.
Do not forget me,
24601.

Look down, look down.
You'll always be a slave.
Look down, look down.
You're standing in your grave.
